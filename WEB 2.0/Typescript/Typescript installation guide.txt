For single file

// install lib..
	-> npm install typescript -g
	-> npm install nodemon -g
// run in new CMD(open two terminals)
	-> tsc app.ts -w     0r --watch
	-> nodemon app.js

For multiple ts files in bigger project this commands are not the case.
So for multiple files:

//tsc --init
	-> This is only required once and initialized this project in which
	   we run this command as a typescript project. 
	-> creates tsconfig.json file	
tsconfig.json 
	-> This json file actually tells the compiler how it should actually compile ts to js file.
//tsc -w 
	-> This command compiles all ts files to js files in watch mode
//watchnode
