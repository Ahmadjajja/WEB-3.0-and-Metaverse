		======Internet History======
1) In the 1930s, Vannevar Bush, then president
of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, began work on a hypothetical
electromechanical device that would store all books, records, and
communications, and mechanically link them together by keyword
association, rather than traditional, mostly hierarchical storage models.


2)Only four months after OSRD was founded, President Roosevelt
approved the atomic bomb program known as the Manhattan Project

3)after the war ended in 1945, but two years before he left his role as
director of the OSRD, Bush wrote two famous essays. The first, “Science,
the Endless Frontier,” was addressed to the president and in it, Bush called
for an increase in government investments in science and technology, rather
than a peacetime reduction, as well as the establishment of the National
Science Foundation. The second essay, “As We May Think,” app.

4) Bush’s Memex was informing
the creation and evolution of “hypertext,” one of the underlying concepts of
the World Wide Web, which is typically written in the HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) and enables users to instantly access a nearly infinite 
extent of online content by clicking on a given piece of text

5)The idea of the Metaverse is also inseparable from the ideas of the Memex




Metaverse 

chapter (1)...


a) It is here that fears of a Metaverse dystopia seem fair, rather than
alarmist. The very idea of the Metaverse means an ever-growing share of
our lives, labor, leisure, time, wealth, happiness, and relationships will be
spent inside virtual worlds, rather than just extended or aided through
digital devices and software. It will be a parallel plane of existence for
millions, if not billions, of people, that sits atop our digital and physical
economies, and unites both.

chapter (3)...

“A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D
virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an
effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence,
and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects,
communications, and payments.”

This chapter all about this defination and will explain each term in this 
chapter.
