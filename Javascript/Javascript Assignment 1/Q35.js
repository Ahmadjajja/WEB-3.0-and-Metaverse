// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. 
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name 
// of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A
//  dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these 
// animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!


let animals = ["rabbit", "dog", "goats"];

for (let index = 0; index < animals.length; index++) {
    const element = animals[index];
    console.log(element)
}

for (let index = 0; index < animals.length; index++) {
    const element = animals[index];
    console.log(`A  ${animals[index]} would make a great pet.`)

}
console.log("I like these animals  coz .................................")
